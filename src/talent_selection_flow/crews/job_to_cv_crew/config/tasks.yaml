# YAML-first task definitions
identify_gaps_task:
  description: >
    Using the following inputs:
    - Job description: {structured_job}
    - Matched CVs Dictionary: {related_cvs}

    Instructions:
    1. The `Matched CVs Dictionary` contains top matches where the key is the CV ID.
    2. For each CV ID, compare the `skills`, `industries`, `experience_level`, and `summary` against the job description.
    3. Identify specific "Gaps"—missing technologies, years of experience, or industry exposure.
    4. Do not hallucinate skills; if the CV doesn't explicitly mention a skill required, mark it as a potential gap.

  expected_output: >
    For each cv_id, identify:
      - matched_skills: skills that appear both in the job requirements and are clearly evidenced in the candidate CV
      - missing_must_have: required "must-have" skills/experiences not evidenced in the candidate CV

    The output must organize results per cv_id and follow a strict JSON structure:
    {
      "docs": {
        "CV_ID": {
          "matched_skills": ["skill1", "skill2"],
          "missing_must_have": ["req1", "req2"],
        }
      }
    }
    Additional rules:
    - Only return the JSON — no commentary before or after.

generate_interview_questions_task:
  description: >
    Using:
    - Context

    For each analyzed cv, generate 5-10 interview questions.
    Include:
    - Questions validating matched skills (1-3)
    - Questions probing must-have gaps (2-4)
    - Questions clarifying ambiguities (1-3)
    - Questions assessing seniority alignment (1-2)

  expected_output: >
    Return a strict JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "docs": {
        "CV_ID": {
          "matched_skill_questions": [
            {"question": "...", "response": "..."}
          ],
          "gap_probing_questions": [
            {"question": "...", "response": "..."}
          ],
          "ambiguity_clarification_questions": [
            {"question": "...", "response": "..."}
          ],
          "seniority_questions": [
            {"question": "...", "response": "..."}
          ],
        }
      }
    }
    Additional rules:
    - Every question must have a short correct response.
    - Only return the JSON — no commentary before or after.
